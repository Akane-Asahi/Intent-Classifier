# Intent-Classifier


---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Run the Google Colab notebook
2. Upload `intent_data.csv` when prompted
3. Train the model and test queries
4. Try your own inputs like:
   - “Is hijab mandatory?”
   - “Give me a hadith about smiling”
   - “Salaam!”

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to build an **intent classifier** for faith-oriented dialogue
- How to semantically embed user queries using transformers
- How to evaluate multiclass classifiers with confusion matrices
- Importance of understanding **what users want**, not just what they say

---

## 🧱 Next Step

This project becomes the **brain** of my chatbot:
- It detects the user's intent
- It triggers the Qur’an/Hadith retrieval, fatwa rulebase, or advice generator
- Can be integrated into LangChain or RAG pipeline later

## 🔬 My AI Research Roadmap

This is the third step in building an explainable, ethical AI system for Islamic knowledge applications:

🧠 Project 3: You are here .. 
🧩 Project 4: Build a rule-based + ML-based chatbot engine  
🤖 Project 5: Fine-tune LLMs on faith-aligned data (e.g., FaithDial)  

## 🤝 Author & Motivation
Built by Telot as part of a personal and academic journey to explore the intersection of:

📜 Faith-based knowledge  
🧠 Responsible AI  
🧪 Research in NLP and conversational agents  

This project is my first practical step toward a Muslim scholar chatbot that is rooted in verified sources and ethical design.
